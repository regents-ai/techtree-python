"""What ``techtree proof verify`` puts in front of a person. Spec section 7.12.

Three hundred and thirty-nine checks run on an ordinary proof bundle, and every
one of them is named, in the machine contract, for the failure it would have
reported. That vocabulary is right for a caller that branches on it and wrong
for a reader being told that nothing is wrong: a person who is handed three
hundred rows headed ``signature_verification_failed``, each marked passed, has
been handed an alarm rather than an answer.

So this module tests the two halves of that separately, because they pull in
opposite directions.

*A proof that holds together is counted, never enumerated.* Its checks are
grouped under headings that say what was confirmed, the counts add up to every
check that ran, and no identifier and no error code reaches the page at all.
The full list is there for whoever asks for it, and it is named the same way.

*A proof that does not hold together is enumerated, whole.* Every failure keeps
its exact identifier and its exact code, verbatim, and gains the heading and
the subject that say where in the bundle the trouble is. A failing verification
is the one place more detail is always the right answer.

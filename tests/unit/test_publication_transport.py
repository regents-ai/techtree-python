"""The one step that opens a socket. Decisions document 0038.

Two of these tests are about an address and need no server: a proof bundle and a
volunteered address travel over a channel nobody can read or rewrite, and
neither is ever put where a proxy log, an access log or a browser history would
keep it.

The rest are about the exchange, and they are exercised rather than read.
Decisions 0038's founder ruling closed three holes here — a redirect that was
refused only in a docstring, an answer nobody checked the type of, and a size cap
read in a way that could not tell "four megabytes" from "at least four
megabytes" — and each of the three is a behaviour of ``urlopen`` rather than of
this repository's own code. A test that asserted over the source would pass
against a build that had silently gone back to the default opener, so instead
each one is put in front of a real HTTPS server that does the wrong thing.

The server is local, ephemeral, and speaks TLS with a certificate generated in
the test and trusted for the length of it through ``SSL_CERT_FILE``. That is what
lets the transport be exercised as itself: no argument is substituted, no method
is patched, and the request that goes out is the request a person's publication
would make.

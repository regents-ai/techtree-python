"""Watching a comparison from the outside. Spec section 6.20.

A concurrent Campaign has two positions at once, and the two commands a caller
uses to follow it have to say so honestly: status exposes both sides' episode
counts to a program and shows them side by side to a person, and logs can be
pointed at one side's evaluation rather than at the worker's own output.

Four rules are tested here, and each of them is a rule about not overstating
what is known.

*No delta before both sides finish.* A partial mean of a partial run reads like
an answer. The score column says provisional and the table carries the sentence
that explains why.

*A variant's log is the engine's log.* Never the child's captured stdout, which
with rich output disabled is a dump of every subject transcript.

*A variant that has not started says so.* Asking for a log that does not exist
yet is an ordinary answer, not a crash.

*A run that has ended reports no position.* Progress measures work in flight
through the phase a run is in, and a run that has finished has none. The phase
already says what happened, so the row is left out rather than filled in.

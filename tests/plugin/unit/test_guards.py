"""Attacking the narrative guards. Specification section 8.7, decision 0007.

Each test here is an attempt to get something past the guards that would make
a local result read as more than it is: a status nobody assigned, a digest
that looks like evidence, a command to run. The guards are only worth having
if these fail, so these are written as attacks.

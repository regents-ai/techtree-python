"""What the plugin's public copy may and may not claim. Decision 0013.

Three claims are easy to make by accident and expensive to have made: that
nothing is sent anywhere, that no account is needed, and that somebody other
than the participant verified the run. None of the three is true of Techtree
v0.1, and each one is the kind of sentence that gets written by a person
trying to be reassuring rather than by a person trying to be exact.

So the copy is scanned rather than reviewed. Every surface a user or the host
agent actually reads is here: the model-visible tool schemas, the `/techtree`
command surface, the guided-revision disclosure, the README, and the operator
Skill with its references.

Decision 0018 added a fourth boundary to the three above: the guided revision
may produce nothing useful, and copy may not promise otherwise.

Decision 0025 adds two more, and they are the same mistake twice. The Campaign
declares a maximum spend and a per-episode timeout; nothing works out what a
run will come to before it starts, nothing watches the spending while it runs,
and nothing ends a run when the declared time is up. A declared figure is a
contract value, and copy that phrases one as a meter or a cut-off is telling
the reader a protection exists. So the copy may not promise a price in advance,
may not promise that spending stops a run, and may not promise that a run is
over by any particular time.

`skills/skill-improver/SKILL.md` is deliberately absent. It is founder-written
and frozen by digest, it is never shown to a user, and a test that could
demand an edit to it would be a test that could break a release coordinate.

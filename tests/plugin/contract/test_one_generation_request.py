"""One completion means one outbound generation request. Decision 0015 s4.

The one-turn promise is not a promise about a method signature. It is a
promise about how many times a model is asked to generate, and the place that
has to hold is the provider boundary — `HermesHostLlm.complete_structured`,
the single point where this plugin hands work to the host's sampling stack.

What these tests lock is everything on this side of that boundary:

* a counting double that treats a second request as a failure never sees one,
  through the one-shot wrapper and through the improvement service;
* an unusable answer spends the attempt and returns a typed failure, without
  a repair completion;
* a transport failure returns a typed failure without a retry, and does not
  spend the attempt, because nothing was produced to spend it on;
* the plugin owns no HTTP client, so there is no client-level retry setting
  to disable — proved statically rather than asserted.

What they cannot lock is what Hermes does inside the one call it is handed.
That is stated in `llm.py`, recorded per attempt as a request count, and left
to the host to account for. A test that claimed otherwise would be a test
making a promise this repository cannot keep.

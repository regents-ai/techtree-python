"""Loading the plugin does nothing to the machine.

Specification sections 7.4, 7.15, 7.16, and the binding rule in section 16
that no plugin may install during ``register()``.

This is the plugin's most important test. A user who lists, installs, or
enables plugins has approved exactly that and nothing else. So registration is
held to a hard line here: with every way of starting a process, opening a
socket, or writing a file replaced by a tripwire, ``register()`` must still
finish normally.

A model call is covered by the same net. The plugin runtime imports only the
standard library — the doctor's runtime-imports check enforces that — so the
only ways it could reach a model are a subprocess or a socket, and both fail
here.

"""Turning the plugin off, and taking it away. WP11g B2.

The README promises what stays on the machine after a disable or a remove.
A promise about disk is worth what its test is worth, so this checks the parts
that can be checked from inside the repository:

* the plugin surfaces exist only because ``register()`` put them there — a
  host that never registers has none of them, which is what disabling is;
* importing the package registers nothing, so an installed-but-not-enabled
  plugin is genuinely inert;
* one directory is the whole of what the plugin can leave on disk, and it is
  the one the README names as the folder a person deletes themselves.

What cannot be checked here is checked nowhere else either, and is stated
rather than implied: this repository cannot uninstall a plugin from a real
Hermes, and it cannot reach into a model provider's retention. The README says
so in those words, and the last test holds it to saying so.

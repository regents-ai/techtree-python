"""The run state machine and its projection. Spec sections 18.2, 7.6.

Everything in this module is a pure function of the event log. Nothing here
touches the filesystem, the clock, or the process table, which is what makes
"the state rebuilds from the events alone" a property that can be tested rather
than a claim.

The normal path is a straight line::

    created → validating_taskset → running_baseline → running_candidate
    → building_receipts → verifying_comparison → building_report → completed

``running_variants`` is the one branch off it: a run whose two variants execute
side by side leaves ``validating_taskset`` for it instead of for
``running_baseline``, and rejoins the line at ``building_receipts``. The
sequential pair stays for the fake executor.

Two escapes leave it. Any phase that is still working may fail, and any phase
that is still working may have cancellation requested of it; a run that has been
asked to stop then reaches ``cancelled`` when the worker winds down, or
``failed`` if it breaks while doing so. ``completed``, ``failed``, and
``cancelled`` have no outgoing edges at all: once a run has ended, its log is
closed.

No phase has an edge to itself. A run does still have things to report while it
stays where it is — the worker's process id, its progress through a phase, the
digest of the report it just wrote, and how each variant of a concurrent
comparison is getting on — but those are a closed set of events, named
in :data:`techtree.runs.events.SAME_PHASE_EVENT_KINDS`, and
:func:`validate_same_phase_event` rather than the transition table is what
admits them. Recording them as events is what keeps the projection derivable
from the log; recording them anywhere else would make ``state.json`` hold facts
the log cannot rebuild.

One fact deliberately does not come from events: ``heartbeat_at``. A liveness
signal refreshed every couple of seconds would bury a run's actual history under
thousands of lines that mean nothing after the fact, so the heartbeat is a
single overwritten file and :func:`reduce_events` always leaves the field unset.
:class:`techtree.runs.store.RunStore` merges it in.

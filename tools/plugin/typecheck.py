"""Type-check the Hermes plugin's tests and the tooling that runs them.

Both import the plugin package, which is the sibling checkout's directory, and
mypy identifies a package by its directory name: `techtree-plugin` is not a
Python identifier. The checkout is therefore given an importable name through
a temporary symbolic link, the passes run against that name, and the link is
discarded. Nothing in either checkout is touched.

The plugin package itself is checked in its own repository, by its own
`make typecheck`. What is checked here is what lives here: the tests and the
tooling, each from its own directory, where they are ordinary top-level
modules, exactly as pytest and the Makefile run them.
